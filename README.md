# Superstore Sales Analytics Dashboard (Bootcamp Capstone Project)

This project is the final capstone for my 4-month Data Analytics Bootcamp. It presents an in-depth analysis of Superstore's sales data using Power BI, covering the years 2014 to 2017. The dataset contains approximately 5,000 orders and offers insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and shipping efficiency.

The dashboard is divided into **five interactive pages**, each answering critical business questions that every retail decision-maker cares about.

2. **Boost sales in underperforming regions**, particularly the East.
3. **Review high-loss customer accounts** and adjust discount or order policies.
4. **Fix shipping delays** in DC, Maine, and Wyoming — possibly improve logistics.
5. **Clarify and leverage ‘Organic’ sales** — if digital, expand it; if unassigned, improve tracking.
6. **Promote high-margin products** through better marketing and sales campaigns.
