# Super-Store-Sales-Analysis
This project is the final capstone for my 4-month Data Analytics Bootcamp. It presents an in-depth analysis of Superstore's sales data using Power BI, covering the years 2014 to 2017. The dataset contains approximately 5,000 orders and offers insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and shipping efficiency.
